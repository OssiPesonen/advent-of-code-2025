# Advent of code 2025

Trying to solve some of the puzzles in [Advent of Code, 2025](https://adventofcode.com/) if I find the time. This year using C#. 


## Getting started

Create an `input.txt` at the root of the project directory with your puzzle input. 

 Once that's done run `dotnet run -- --puzzle day1part1` to execute a specific puzzle.

If you have [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev) installed, just hit `task run:1:1` where the first `1` is the day and latter `1` is the part of the puzzle.
