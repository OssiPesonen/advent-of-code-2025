# Advent of code 2025

Trying to solve some of the puzzles in [Advent of Code, 2025](https://adventofcode.com/) if I find the time. This year using C#. 

If you have [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev) installed, just hit `task run:1:1` where the first number is the day and the second the part of the problem (1/2).
